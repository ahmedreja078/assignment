    "Encapsulation: \n",

The convention in Python is to use a single underscore prefix for attributes that should be considered private and two underscores for name mangling. Python does not have explicit support for protected access, but this convention is commonly used to denote that an attribute or method should be considered protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: \n",
    "Abstraction is achieved in Python through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Python does not have a built-in interface keyword, but interfaces can be implemented using abstract classes with abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: \n",
    "Inheritance is achieved in Python using the same syntax as other OOP languages. Classes can inherit from a single superclass using the class SubClass(SuperClass): syntax. Multiple inheritance is also supported in Python, where a class can inherit from multiple superclasses using the class SubClass(SuperClass1, SuperClass2, ...): syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism is achieved in Python through the use of method overloading and method overriding. Method overloading is not supported in Python, but it can be simulated using default arguments and variable-length argument lists. Method overriding is achieved in the same way as other OOP languages, by defining a method in a subclass with the same name and signature as a method in the superclass.\n",
