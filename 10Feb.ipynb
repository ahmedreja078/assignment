Second, it ensures that files are always properly closed, even in the presence of errors or exceptions. Finally, it provides better performance and efficiency, as the file is closed as soon as the with block is finished executing, rather than waiting until the end of the program. Overall, using the with statement with open() is considered to be a best practice when working with files in Python."
